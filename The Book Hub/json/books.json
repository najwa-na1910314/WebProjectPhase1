        "longDescription": "Only a handful of Information Technology leaders understand the complete range of IT issues, from basic technology to business strategy. One of them, Harold Lorin, has written a definitive guide for the IT decision maker, the technologist, and the system developer.    The breadth and insight of Doing IT Right is unparalleled. Its usefulness as a guide to deeper understanding of business computing will be appreciated by professionals and managers at all levels. This book covers a rich collection of topics, each explained, interrelated, and placed in a coherent framework so that its importance and likely evolution are clear. The author does not shy away from stating his views; he provides color, insight and humor.    Doing IT Right is a tour de force based on Lorin's prodigious knowledge of the industry derived from years of involvement with development and marketing at IBM and other systems houses and from consulting in a variety of environments. It also has its roots in a great many publications of the author, from trade and journal articles and book chapters to six earlier books.    Doing IT Right explores IT in its full complexity. It explains fundamental issues of hardware and software structures; it illuminates central issues of networking and encapsulates the essence of client/server computing; its coverage of costing, risk assessment, and due diligence in making computing decisions is unique; its presentation of the concepts and issues of object-orientation was considered by the managers at an IBM development laboratory to be Unique and more informative than fifteen other OO presentations put together.",

This book discusses ATM as the key technology for transforming the enterprise network from data-only to an integrated data, voice, video, image and multimedia corporate infrastructure.

        "longDescription": "To be successful, any significant application has to manage the flow of data effectively. Microsoft   s approach to data has taken another major step forward with the new Entity Framework for .NET. The Entity Framework starts with ideas from Object Relational Management (ORM) tools like NHibernate that help bridge the mismatch between relational databases (like SQL Server) and object oriented languages (like C# and VB.NET). But it also blends in the established ADO.NET model and recent language-based innovations of LINQ to create a powerful new data management paradigm.

        "longDescription": "The static Web is going out of style. Its click-and-wait user experience is giving way to dynamic personalized content and intuitive interactions. With ASP 2.0, a web developer can compose a page out of separate working parts \"Web Parts\" that independently communicate with the server to produce rich interactive portals like Yahoo!, Google/ig, and Live.com. The new Web Parts API makes it easy to centrally manage a portal's parts.    ASP.NET 2.0 Web Parts in Action is packed with annotated code, diagrams, and crystal-clear discussions. You'll develop a sample project from design to deployment, adding content zones, personalization, and a custom look-and-feel. Since any website is invariably a work-in-progress, you'll appreciate learning how to upgrade your portals on the fly. Along the way you'll pick up handy code instrumentation techniques and a few tricks to help your portals manage themselves. As an added bonus, the book introduces the Microsoft Ajax Library (\"Atlas\") and shows how you can add Ajax to a web part. You  ll even create a Live.com gadget.    This book is for web developers familiar with ASP.NET.",

        "longDescription": "Cascading Style Sheets paint the web as the user sees it, and for fifteen years, we've been painting the web by hand. Sass and Compass extend standard CSS to give you more flexibility and the option to simplify or automate many tedious tasks. Think of Sass and Compass as power tools that allow stylesheet authors to \"paint\" with remarkable speed and precision.    Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding language features for creating well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin. Compass is a framework that sits atop Sass and tackles common stylesheet problems such as grid layouts, handling CSS3 vendor differences, and production environment stylesheet optimization. Together, they do for CSS what jQuery has done for JavaScript: solve real world problems, letting designers and developers create stylesheets more efficiently.    Sass and Compass in Action is the definitive guide to stylesheet authoring using these two revolutionary tools. Written for both designers and developers, this book demonstrates the power of both Sass and Compass through a series of examples that address common pain points associated with traditional stylesheet authoring. The book begins with simple topics such as CSS resets and moves on to more involved topics such as grid frameworks and CSS3 vendor implementation differences.    Authors Wynn Netherland, Nathan Weizenbaum, and Chris Eppstein cover prominent community plugins that allows stylesheet authors to share styles as developers of other programming languages such as Ruby, Python, Java, and, .NET do. The book also presents Sass and Compass case studies using hot technologies like Sencha Touch. The book culminates in a step-by-step look at building a personal stylesheet framework in which readers can bundle their own approaches and opinions and reuse them across projects.",
