Sass and Compass extend standard CSS to give you more flexibility and the option to simplify or automate many tedious tasks. Think of Sass and Compass as power tools that allow stylesheet authors to \"paint\" with remarkable speed and precision.    Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding language features for creating well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin. Compass is a framework that sits atop Sass and tackles common stylesheet problems such as grid layouts, handling CSS3 vendor differences, and production environment stylesheet optimization. Together, they do for CSS what jQuery has done for JavaScript: solve real world problems, letting designers and developers create stylesheets more efficiently.
